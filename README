This prototype for the seaclear website has a pipenv in it that you can use to get all dependencies, this means you need pip and pipenv.
if this is not working then please just make sure you install the listed dependencies in the Pipfile

This prototype also requires a local instatiation of mongoDB on "localhost:27017"

Once both prerequisites have been done, you can use pop_sample.py to get some sample data in the database which will add 2 users for you to use:
-admin:
email = admin@example.com
password = adminpass
-user:
email = user1@example.com
password = password123

**DO NOT RUN "AddData.py"**
This does not work and will populate your mongoDB with garbage
