    <h2>Welcome to SeaClear</h2>
    <p>
      Cape Townâ€™s stunning beaches are a major attraction for both residents and
      visitors. The city's beautiful coastline and mild Mediterranean climate
      offer the perfect setting for various seaside activities. However, issues
      with water quality, particularly during busy times, pose significant
      health risks. Despite concerns, many beachgoers are unaware of the poor
      water quality due to inadequate communication methods. Reports have
      highlighted high levels of pollutants at some beaches, leading to serious
      health issues for swimmers.

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The purpose of the SeaClear project is to provide Capetonians and tourists
      with real-time, accurate water quality information for local beaches
      through a mobile-friendly website. By offering this crucial data, the
      platform aims to enhance public health and safety, empowering users to
      make informed decisions about where to swim.

    <h2>Our Vision</h2>
    <p>
      We envision a future where every beachgoer in Cape Town has easy access to
      up-to-date information on water quality, ensuring a safer and more
      enjoyable beach experience. Our goal is to foster a well-informed
      community that values both the beauty of Cape Town's beaches and the
      importance of maintaining their health and safety.
